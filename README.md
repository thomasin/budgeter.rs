learning rust through trial by fire

**progress**
1. followed diesel [getting started guide](https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started/)
2. using [clap](https://clap.rs/) and following their subcommands example
3. decided to implement my own cli outputter.  
   it's pretty bad rn but making it nice will be good for learning.
4. renamed lib to libr (creative). centralised mods around main. lib
   signals library code entrypoint apparently.
5. impl [queryable](https://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/deserialize/trait.Queryable.html)
   for items. fun
