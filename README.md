learning rust through trial by fire

**progress**
1. followed diesel [getting started guide](https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started/)
2. using [clap](https://clap.rs/) and following their subcommands example
3. decided to implement my own cli outputter.  
   it's pretty bad rn but making it nice will be good for learning.
